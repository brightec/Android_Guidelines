# Code guidelines

Ensure that you regularly use the Android Studio 'Reformat Code' (ALT+CMD+L) tool which will reformat a file to match your code style settings. This should, as a minimum, be used before a submission is made on every file that you have changed in that submission. This will reduce the code review time and keep the code tidier.

## Inspiration

This style-guide is like for like with the [Raywenderlich Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/kotlin-style-guide), with a few minor tweaks. So please check that out. The [Android Kotlin Guides](https://android.github.io/kotlin-guides/) are another great source for styling.

## Nomenclature

On the whole, naming should follow Java standards, as Kotlin is a JVM-compatible language.

### Packages

Package names are similar to Java: all __lower-case__, multiple words concatenated together, without hypens or underscores:

__BAD__:

```kotlin
com.RayWenderlich.funky_widget
```

__GOOD__:

```kotlin
com.raywenderlich.funkywidget
```

### Classes & Interfaces

Written in __UpperCamelCase__. For example `RadialSlider`. 

### Methods

Written in __lowerCamelCase__. For example `setValue`.

### Fields

Generally, written in __lowerCamelCase__. Fields should **not** be named with Hungarian notation, as Hungarian notation is [erroneously thought](http://jakewharton.com/just-say-no-to-hungarian-notation/) to be recommended by Google.

Example field names:

```kotlin
class MyClass {
  var publicField: Int = 0
  val person = Person()
  private var privateField: Int?
}
```

Constant values in the companion object should be written in __uppercase__, with an underscore separating words:

```kotlin
companion object {
  const val THE_ANSWER = 42
}
```

### Variables & Parameters

Written in __lowerCamelCase__.

Single character values must be avoided, except for temporary looping variables.

### Misc

In code, acronyms should be treated as words. For example:

__BAD:__

```kotlin
XMLHTTPRequest
URL: String? 
findPostByID
```
__GOOD:__

```kotlin
XmlHttpRequest
url: String
findPostById
```

## Declarations

### Visibility Modifiers

Only include visibility modifiers if you need something other than the default of public.

**BAD:**

```kotlin
public val wideOpenProperty = 1
private val myOwnPrivateProperty = "private"
```

**GOOD:***

```kotlin
val wideOpenProperty = 1
private val myOwnPrivateProperty = "private"
```

### Access Level Modifiers

Access level modifiers should be explicitly defined for classes, methods and member variables.

### Fields & Variables

Prefer single declaration per line.

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
username: String
twitterHandle: String
```

### Classes

Exactly one class per source file, although inner classes are encouraged where scoping appropriate.

### Data Type Objects

Prefer data classes for simple data holding objects.

__BAD:__

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String) {
  override fun toString() : String {
    return "Person(name=$name)"
  }
}
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
data class Person(val name: String)
```

### Enum Classes

**TODO: UPDATE FOR KOTLIN** *(This is java-only and may not be true with Kotlin)*

Enum classes should be avoided where possible, due to a large memory overhead. Static constants are preferred. See http://developer.android.com/training/articles/memory.html#Overhead for further details.

Enum classes without methods may be formatted without line-breaks, as follows:

```kotlin
private enum CompassDirection { EAST, NORTH, WEST, SOUTH }
```

## Named Parameters

When calling any function (not possible when calling java functions) with more than 2 parameters, you must make use of the named parameters language feature.

__BAD:__

```kotlin
myFunction(1, true, ourString)
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
myFunction(parameterSize = 1, isNecessary = true, name = ourString)
```

It is not considered bad practice either way for functions of 2 parameters or less.

The same style should be applied to constructor invocation too.

## Spacing

Spacing is especially important in raywenderlich.com code, as code needs to be easily readable as part of the tutorial. 

### Indentation

Indentation is using spaces - never tabs.

#### Blocks

Indentation for blocks uses 2 spaces (not the default 4):

__BAD:__

```kotlin
for (i in 0..9) {
    Log.i(TAG, "index=" + i);
}
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
for (i in 0..9) {
  Log.i(TAG, "index=" + i)
}
```

#### Line Wraps

Indentation for line wraps should use 4 spaces (not the default 8):

__BAD:__

```kotlin
val widget: CoolUiWidget =
        someIncrediblyLongExpression(that, reallyWouldNotFit, on, aSingle, line)
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
val widget: CoolUiWidget =
    someIncrediblyLongExpression(that, reallyWouldNotFit, on, aSingle, line)
```

### Line Length

Lines should be no longer than 100 characters long.


### Vertical Spacing

There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but having too many sections in a method often means you should refactor into several methods.

## Semicolons

Semicolons ~~are dead to us~~ should be avoided wherever possible in Kotlin. 

__BAD__:

```kotlin
val horseGiftedByTrojans = true;
if (horseGiftedByTrojans) {
  bringHorseIntoWalledCity();
}
```

__GOOD__:

```kotlin
val horseGiftedByTrojans = true
if (horseGiftedByTrojans) {
  bringHorseIntoWalledCity()
}
```

## Getters & Setters

Unlike Java, direct access to fields in Kotlin is preferred. 

If custom getters and setters are required, they should be declared [following Kotlin conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/properties.html) rather than as separate methods.

## Brace Style

Only trailing closing-braces are awarded their own line. All others appear the same line as preceding code:

__BAD:__

```kotlin
class MyClass
{
  fun doSomething()
  {
    if (someTest)
    {
      // ...
    }
    else
    {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
class MyClass {
  fun doSomething() {
    if (someTest) {
      // ...
    } else {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

Conditional statements are always required to be enclosed with braces, irrespective of the number of lines required.

__BAD:__

```kotlin
if (someTest)
  doSomething()
if (someTest) doSomethingElse()
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
if (someTest) {
  doSomething()
}
if (someTest) { doSomethingElse() }
```

## When Statements

Unlike `switch` statements in Java, `when` statements do not fall through. Separate cases using commas if they should be handled the same way. Always include the else case.

__BAD:__

```kotlin
when (anInput) {
  1 -> doSomethingForCaseOne()
  2 -> doSomethingForCaseOneOrTwo()
  3 -> doSomethingForCaseThree()
}
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
when (anInput) {
  1, 2 -> doSomethingForCaseOneOrTwo()
  3 -> doSomethingForCaseThree()
  else -> println("No case satisfied")
}
```

## Annotations

Standard annotations should be used - in particular `override`. This should appear on the same line as the function declaration.

__BAD:__

```kotlin
fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
}
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
}
```

## Types 

Always use Kotlin's native types when available. Kotlin is JVM-compatible so **[TODO: more info]**

### Type Inference

Type inference should be preferred where possible to explicitly declared types. 

__BAD:__

```kotlin
val something: MyType = MyType()
val meaningOfLife: Int = 42
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
val something = MyType()
val meaningOfLife = 42
```

### Constants vs. Variables 

Constants are defined using the `val` keyword, and variables with the `var` keyword. Always use `val` instead of `var` if the value of the variable will not change.

*Tip*: A good technique is to define everything using `val` and only change it to `var` if the compiler complains!

### Companion Objects

** TODO: A bunch of stuff about companion objects **

### Nullable Types

Declare variables and function return types as nullable with `?` where a `null` value is acceptable.

Use implicitly unwrapped types declared with `!!` only for instance variables that you know will be initialized before use, such as subviews that will be set up in `onCreate` for an Activity or `onCreateView` for a Fragment.

When naming nullable variables and parameters, avoid naming them like `nullableString` or `maybeView` since their nullability is already in the type declaration.

When accessing a nullable value, use the safe call operator if the value is only accessed once or if there are many nullables in the chain:

```kotlin
editText?.setText("foo")
```

**TODO: Update the rest of this section from Swift**

Use optional binding when it's more convenient to unwrap once and perform multiple operations:

```swift
if let textContainer = self.textContainer {
  // do many things with textContainer
}
```

For optional binding, shadow the original name when appropriate rather than using names like unwrappedView or actualLabel.

```swift
Preferred:

var subview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

// later on...
if let subview = subview, let volume = volume {
  // do something with unwrapped subview and volume
}
```

Not Preferred:

```swift
var optionalSubview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

if let unwrappedSubview = optionalSubview {
  if let realVolume = volume {
    // do something with unwrappedSubview and realVolume
  }
}
``` 

## Language

Use `en-US` English spelling.

__BAD:__

```kotlin
val colourName = "red"
```

__GOOD:__

```kotlin
colorName = "red"
```
